# Shallow water benchmark
#
# A 1D benchmark configuration consisting of a steady flow over an inclined 
# plane with Manning's friction. See section 4.1 of [1] for details.
#
# This configuration uses an explicit ERK(3, 3, 1) timestepping. Expected
# results are reported in shallow_water-steady_incline_1d-erk33-l9.baseline
