##
#
# Euler (optimized polytropic gas EOS) benchmark:
#
# The Smooth traveling wave is an analytic solution of the compressible
# Euler equations (with polytropic gas equation of state). We report the
# final, normalized L1, L2, L\infty error norms summed up over the rho,
# m_1, and E components.
#
# This configuration uses an explicit ERK(3, 3, 1) timestepping.
# Expected results are reported in euler-smooth_wave-erk33.baseline
#
# Compile time options: dim = 1, Number = double
